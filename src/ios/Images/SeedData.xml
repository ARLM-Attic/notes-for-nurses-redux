He&#xA;serves as chairman of the board's Finance Committee and as a member of the Sustainability&#xA;Committee. He also served as chief executive officer of the company from October 2001 to&#xA;September 2006, when he was named executive chairman.&#xA;As CEO, Mr. Ford improved quality, lowered costs and delivered exciting new products. During his&#xA;time in that position he took the company from a $5.5 billion loss in 2001 to three straight years of&#xA;profitability. Through the years, his vision for the company has remained unchanged.&#xA;“I want us to be a company that makes a difference in people's lives; one that delights its customers,&#xA;rewards its shareholders and makes the world a better place,” he says. “To do that we are focused on&#xA;delivering desirable products, a competitive cost structure and a sustainable business model.”&#xA;Mr. Ford joined Ford Motor Company in 1979 as a product planning analyst. He subsequently held&#xA;a variety of positions in manufacturing, sales, marketing, product development and finance.
